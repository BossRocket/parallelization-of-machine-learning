-NOTE: our runtime should be saved onto the .ipynb file which should display our results that 
we recieved for our expirement. The steps below are only for if the content does not display 
correctly and you need to run the file again.

Deployment on Google Colab:
-Download and unzip the compressed folder containing the source code and the dataset.
-Upload the .ipynb file onto Google Colab.
-Starting from the first cell, click the play button on the left to run.
	-- On the very first cell, you will be required to click the "Choose files" button
	   and navigate to the location of the dataset file.
	-- NOTE: make sure that the name of the input file matches the one in the code for
	   the cell that comes after the "Reading in the Dataset" text cell.
-Run every cell this way in sequence from top to bottom.
